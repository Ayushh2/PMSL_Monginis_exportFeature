    "title": "Excellence Baked by Innovation",
    "description": "Monginis began in early 1900s Mumbai as a charming bakery founded by two Italian brothers. Acquired by the Khorakiwala family in 1956, it retained its artisanal roots while expanding across India and Egypt. Today, Monginis operates over 1,500 outlets in India and 120+ in Egypt, supported by 20 advanced manufacturing facilities, including a flagship in Bhiwandi. Known for introducing 100% vegetarian cakes, Monginis offers a wide range of long shelf-life baked goods — from cookies and rusks to premium cakes and pastries.",
